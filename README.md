# wrap-battle

Wrap Battle is a little quiz game that teaches players the difference between mexican dishes like tacos, burritos, tortillas, wraps or enchilladas.
The game will be for multiple players, who compete against each other in answering questions (similar to Kahoot). The player with the most points, e.g. the most correct and fastest answers, wins the game. 

Another idea is to implement Wrap Battle in the form of a "memory" in which one or more players compete against each other on a turn-based basis. A duo of cards consists of a term (e.g. enchilladas) and a picture.

In principle, this app could also be expanded by features like an interactive map with a restaurant finder or a recipe exchange between players (social feature).
